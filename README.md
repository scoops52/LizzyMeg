# Why I built this project 
I made this project for a client. A professional dancer who needed a website to market herself for future gigs. 
Becuase of this I gained a lot of experience working with a client and bringing their vision to life. 
It also helped me improve my skills in responsive web design as well as React Router.

# How I built this project 
I first had to understand what the client wanted in their site. She told me the content she wanted to include and we decided on the best organization of the site. She did not have a hard design or knew exactly what she wanted it to look like but we had multiple conversations to go over certain colors, fonts, and other design elements. 

I used React Router in order to make the site as seamless as possible, and to be able to reuse components throughout the site. The components I built for this site as well as my own personal site actually inspired me to start builing my own UI Kit. 

I spent a lot of time on the design elements, making sure the website was responsive on multiple devices. With so many different design elements, I used SASS (SCSS syntax) instead of just conventional CSS.

# What I would do different next time 
Through all our conversations about the deisgin and organization, next time I would come up with a more concrete design mock-up (something I did when building my own website).

I also would keep page load times in mind while building the site. React Router helps cut down the load time however with all the images, they can sometimes take a bit longer to load. I am planning on fixing this however next time I will keep this in mind while still building the site.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
